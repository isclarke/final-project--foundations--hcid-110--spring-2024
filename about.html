It brings color and variation into the world ...and more excitement. I’m glad that I can bring that to light with my work.” Her fifth illustrated book, Black Icons in Herstory, was released in October 2022. Monica wants to make sure everyone honors their own uniqueness and beauty.</p>

    <h4>Interlude from Monica</h4>
    <p>I grew up in Tucson, Arizona, the second youngest of four siblings. My whole childhood, I was a competitive gymnast. We practiced every day after school for about four hours. That definitely instilled the disciplined side that I have and also my ability to see and understand movement.I guess I’d never really considered myself super creative when I was growing up because I was doing gymnastics so much. My identity as a gymnast was dominant. But after I stopped doing gymnastics late into high school, that’s when the creativity started taking over. I had surgery on my feet the summer between eighth and ninth grade, and I had to sit in a wheelchair for about two months. I was used to being so active. It was when I started teaching myself Photoshop and animation. I would animate my gymnastics routines, things like that.</p>
